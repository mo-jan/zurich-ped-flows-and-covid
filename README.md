# Covid-19 & Zürich Hardbrücke pedestrian counts

![run updater](https://github.com/mo-jan/traffic-flows/workflows/run%20updater/badge.svg)

## What is it

**Plot intended to evaluate Covid-19 policies, showing [pedestrian flow data from Zurich Hardbrücke station](https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset/vbz_frequenzen_hardbruecke) and [Covid-19 data for Zurich](https://github.com/openZH/covid_19)**

We assume Hardbrücke's northeastern exit is a suitable "barometer" for Zürich's level of party activities. We also assume death figures are the most reliable indicators for Covid-19 (though with 3-4 week delay).
