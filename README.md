# Covid-19 & Zürich Hardbrücke pedestrian counts

## What is it

**Plot intended to support Covid-19 policies, showing [pedestrian flow data from Zurich Hardbrücke station](https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset/vbz_frequenzen_hardbruecke) and Covid-19 death numbers for Zurich**

We assume Hardbrücke's northeastern exit is a suitable "barometer" for Zürich's level of party activities. We also assume death figures are the most reliable indicators for Covid-19 (though with 3-4 week delay).
