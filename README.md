# traffic-flows

## What is it
We monitor mobility and pedestrian flow during corona lockdown policies.

We use [pedestrian flow data from Zurich Hardbrücke station](https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset/vbz_frequenzen_hardbruecke). We assume Hardbrücke's northeastern exit is a suitable "barometer" for Zürich's level of party activities.
